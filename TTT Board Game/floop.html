<h3>1. Why the webpage?</h3>
<p>
I need to (and want to) learn HTML for school. This is excellent practice for me.<br>
Thank you for putting up with my amateurism.

<h3>2. Overview of The Game</h3>
<br>

<h4>It's not Dnd, but you do get a character sheet</h4>
<p>
Your character has been invited to an elegant Christmas Ball! <br>
It was all going so well until something <i>oh-so</i> sinister happened!<br>
This elegant extravaganza has taken a turn for the worse.<br>
The doors have been locked and the only way out seems to be some elaborate puzzle!<br><br>
You must collect enough puzzle pieces from around the mansion and solve the puzzle quickly!<br>
And watch your back, these Christmassy folks can't all be trusted. <br>
There are traitors about looking to take all the points for themselves!

<h3>3. Setting up The Game</h3>
<br>

<h4>First, get all the pieces together</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Take a look through the character sheets. Everyone gets one.</li>
<li>Then find the Ballroom Map item. Place it in the centre of the table.</li>
<li>Shuffle the rest of the map tiles and place them face down in a pile. We will build the map as we go each round.</li>
<li>Yadda yadda yadda</li>
</ol>
